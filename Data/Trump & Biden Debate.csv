@thatradioboy,The United States is so COOKED 💀
@ej12349,First lie. What a joke!  Trump claims that he wants clean water.  The truth is that he wants to help the Corporations dismantle the EPA.
@jacobmay7531,"This is what we have to lead America.This is sad to people fighting each other like children in front of the whole world.
We all need to WAKE UP! Our country looks weak!! How did we get here with these two! Wake up america , it's all a distraction from something bigger!"
@sumbreonrj5746,"As an uninformed outsider, listening to these people was depressing. Trump sounds like he's only pushing Biden to the edge so that Biden doesn't get voted, and Biden sounds way to muffled to actually be taken seriously. Leaving the only racional option that I've been shown to be Trump, wich sounds like he's lying half the time, using exaggerations to make Biden look even worse than he already looks, and not talking at all about himself and actually promoting he's person. Neither of this old men should be chosen for controlling one of the biggest nations on earth.



Also I won't answer anything."

@johndough2523,The only reason you're surprised by Biden's performance is because the Democrat Party has been LYING to you!!!! Maybe it's time to start listening to those of us who have been telling you THE TRUTH this whole time? I was a Registered Democrat my entire adult life until I had a moment of clarity. The leftist mainstream media cannot be trusted.
@tarellalovelace,I’d keep asking if the dummy keeps giving me billions of dollars too. 😂😂
@electricpineapple9023,The fact they believe the economy is strong when inflation is killing the middle class... is a joke

@jdwilson533,"The worst thing NBC can continue to do is control the comments on this debate… We have to put a stop to this, Biden’s awareness is out the window at this point. It’s an embarrassment to us all not mention the dangers of having this man lead OUR COUNTRY!!!"

@tarellalovelace,Can’t stand what Biden has done. He has caused increased gas and food prices just to name a few. He has clearly done some really dumb things. I think it’s time he gives it up and just try to enjoy retirement.

The whole world is laughing at us, I have a lot of friends all over the world and they perceive us now as a ""weak country with no back bone, that can't even show teeth anymore, it 's a helpless baby"". What did this country came to? Illegal immigrants are running our country, taking advantage of what America offers and we, working people, are paying for this."

@BusterMSC1,Biden wants people to believe he is young and cognizant but I literally just watched a campaign video where he is talking about “malarkey”. Who is advising him? Someone trying to make him seem even older than he is? I don’t know anyone under 80 that uses that word. Sabotage from the inside?
@QUEENofHEARTZ1973,Biden is by FAR THE MOST EMBARRASSMENT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
@QUEENofHEARTZ1973,"THE ONLY REASON ANY CHARGES WERE PUSHED ON TRUMP IS BECAUSE BIDEN KNEW THAT THE ONLY WAY HE WOULD BECOME THE PUPET HE NOW IS IS TO LIE AND CHEAT AND FRAME TEUMP AND AMERICANS STAND BY TRUMP CAUSE TRUMP GOT THE BALLS TO STOP CORRUPTION IN THE U.S AMD BIDEN TRYINTO SAVE HIMSELF FROM PROSECUTION FOR BEING THE WORLDS BIGGEST FRAUD , BIDEN HAS MADE AMERICA LOOK LIKE A JOKE !

@QUEENofHEARTZ1973,"Biden is such a liar and proved it, when he said"" i secured the boarders"" when everyone knows biden done 2 things, 1. He took the wall down on day 1 and 2 he allowed bus liads of immigrants in and housed them in hotels at 350 ea.daily 
Also he was caught in a lie when he says vets are better since me, NO VETS ARE HOMELESS & SUFFERING WHILE HE PAYS 350 TO ILLEAGALS DAILY BUT NEVER OAID VETS 350 DAILY !!

@hookalakah,President Joe Biden just had a bad night.  He had a cold.  He had a stutter.  The CNN hosts were in the tank for Trump.  The split-screen was a cheap fake.  You didn't see what you thought you saw.  His advisors were terrible and need to be fired.  His shoes caught on the carpet.  The stairs made him fall.  The other bike rider threw him off his bike.  And the dog ate his homework.
@alshavanattia8773,"Totally agree, a lot of these politicians just need to retire we need some newbies because a lot of them are in their 70s and 80s , That and why not step out of tradition don't get me wrong tradition has its place but not for every decade sometimes it's good to make a different decision and look at history it repeats itself in different decades and in different ways"

@VivaNexLifestyle789,"During the Democratic administration, many H-1B visa IT workers, especially from India, came to the U.S. and received sponsorships for green cards. This influx raised concerns about them taking jobs in the information technology sector. We need to establish laws requiring companies to prioritize hiring American workers and outsourcing American jobs before employing H-1B visa holders for cheaper labor. Our younger generation is at risk. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN - HIRE AMERICANS FIRST!"

@davidisthis,This is so disgusting. One of these guys will be the president. If our ancestors could see us now. These guys are competing for leadership. These two are considered the best of us.
@davidisthis,What Biden did in the nineties doesn't come up enough. I think he should never live that up. No one discussed the crack house legislature because Trump would have supported it as well.

Biden can't even put two words together and has destroyed America and contributed to creating wars all over the place and caos in the international stage. You may even be a democrat (I am politically neutral) but you can't deny that Biden has objectively been a total disaster. America is at serious risk, the world is at risk with Biden President of the United States. People got poorer and mental illness has hit record levels since Biden took office. I hope all Americans will realise that on November 5th they are not just going to vote for an election but they will decide if America will sink down or will prevail and do America, the most important country in the world. Please love your country, vote for Trump."

The moderator obviously does NOT buy groceries himself or he would know this !!
The moderator said groceries that cost $100 dollars during the Trump Presidency cost $120 now with Biden as President !!!
Either the moderator doesn't buy his own groceries, or the moderator gets a $280 Discount !!!😮

I think the moderator is fudging and covering up the horrible facts of the cost of living as a propagandists for Biden.

Also, my home value went from the mid-$200k to now the mid-$400k !!!
That's Double the cost !!!
The moderator said housing cost went up only 30% !!!🤦‍♀️😵‍💫🤪
Again, the moderator is playing the propagandist for Biden to lessen the horribleness of Biden and his Administration."
@silverhills5684,"The man on the right, on stage behind, the lectern, answering the moderator questions is not Joe Biden. This man does an almost convincing portrayal of Joe Biden, but the makeup artist forgot about The Real Joe Biden's dangling ear lobes and The Real Joe Biden's LACK of a cleft chin.
Pull up any picture of Joe Biden in his 40s or 50s when there was no need for Biden to have a double look-alike and you will plainly see his dangling earlobes and cleftless chin.
Age does not change earlobes from dangling to attached, nor does age create a cleft chin. There are other differences, too, from The Real Joe Biden and this almost look-alike imposter, but these 2 differences are enough evidence to recognize this man speaking in the debate is an imposter.

Also, one doesn't even need to pull up a picture of Joe Biden when he was younger, because the picture that is used as the advertisement next to Trump's picture is The Real Joe Biden, but the one on stage answering the debate questions is the imposter.
Notice that in the advertisement picture of The Real Joe Biden, his earlobes are not attached to the side of his face, but the man answering the debate questions has earlobes that are attached to his face. Now notice the picture of The Real Joe Biden in the advertisement picture does NOT have a cleft chin, but the man on stage, answering the questions DOES have a cleft chin.
Those two differences are enough proof, evidence, that the man on stahe, answering the questions is NOT Joe Biden."
@user-wb1si7dn3z,Think about this you all; illegal immigrants and refugees don't want to contribute anything but destruction the fall of our Republic. Look at how New York City is now because the illegal immigrants. It could get like that ANYDAY ANYWHERE. It doesn't make any sense that all of these illegal immigrants can receive thousands of dollars a month plus free housing and free transportation meanwhile the homeless African-Americans and homeless honest hard-working Caucasian people are going broke due to inflation of illegal immigration and crime stemming from it.

@crowleypage8453,Trump is great
@vali81may,Biden took a pill in Ibiza
@Bretjohnson1331,"Really Biden said no troops died under his watch. What about the 13 killed at Kabul, what about the 2 seals killed in Yemen, what about the American aid workers he kiIIed in drone strike he ordered after mistaking them for terrorists.   No terrorist ever crossed the southern border....   What about the 2 isis members that are being held in San Diego after they were caught attempting entry last month that are high value targets on the terror watch list.  All of that is just a few examples and there are plenty more"

@Lanajune1620,Not only does Biden has dementia and is the worst president ever. Biden is also corrupt. Biden and his family gets millions from China. Because China is trying to topple America. So voting for Biden is voting for China to take over America. We need to make America great again. We need to vote for a leader who loves America and put our people first. Let’s vote for the best choice Donald Trump!

@Joe-g1m,"FBI, or anyone else watching Campaign finance laws-----Is the following clairvoyance?  I see individuals purchasing  a certain  (Dumb Joke Trash)  stock.  To go around campaign finance laws.  Foreign investors and other wealthy are contributing campaign dollars to this account to funnel campaign money to a political office seeker.  (I wonder how much is coming from some special Putin accounts set up in other names?)  That is why a basically penny stock is so high.  They will hold the price up until this politico and their minions bail out and sell off at inflated rates.  The contributors will then be able to list their (stock purchases) campaign donations as write offs  for losses in the stock market that they can't do now.  Of course it is going to crash after the sell off.  Is there anything This political con does that isn't a con?"
@raniejornales,Biden got served....he had no come back....already lied bout having troops dying under his administration compared to Trump's.

@Literature-ft8ru,"2:40:32 Source from U.S. House of Representatives Committee 

""..Yesterday, the Subcommittee posted this video from January 6, 2021, which was recorded by Alexandra Pelosi and provided directly to the Subcommittee by HBO. In the video former Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated ""I take responsibility"" for the security failures of the Capitol that day. 
 
“As Nancy Pelosi was being evacuated from the Capitol on January 6, 2021 she admitted that, as Speaker of the House, she was responsible for the security failures, and for not having the National Guard at the Capitol,” said Chairman Loudermilk.

“However, after the dust settled from the breach of the Capitol, she spent 20 million taxpayer dollars for her January 6 Select Committee to create a narrative that shifted the blame on President Trump. The Democrats’ partisan select committee went to great lengths to suppress and hide evidence that didn’t support their predetermined narrative about that day, including this video of Speaker Pelosi admitting that she was responsible for the security failures at the Capitol. My committee will continue to investigate and expose all the facts. The American people deserve the truth.”

This video shows Pelosi in a moment of leadership acknowledging that as Speaker of the House it was her responsibility to ensure the safety of Members of Congress that day and every other day.  However, Pelosi never publicly took responsibility. Instead, Pelosi created the January 6 Select Committee with the purpose of publicly blaming Donald Trump for her own failures. 

Despite Pelosi’s claims yesterday on MSNBC that Republicans are engaging in revisionist history, this clip proves what Republicans have said for three years: it is Pelosi who has been determined to revise history and shift the blame away from herself for security failures at the Capitol on January 6.

@Literature-ft8ru,"2:27:44 Our VETERANS ASSISTANCE has been FAILING our freedom fighting heros for nearly 4 years! I see a dozen homeless vets on the street just baking in the southern 110+  degree California summer sun begging for bread.....
Their account in the VA is SO BACKLOGGED they never get their benefits and some do.
We need the BEST!!! Therapists dor our freedom fighting Heros. They should never have to pay for taxes. And they should all have amazing cuts to buy homes and make it very easy for them to own a home. If they suffer from PTSD or other mental illnesses, they should have all the resources covered for them. I dont care if my taxes get raised. They deserve all the help and support they need to get back on their feet. If they need prosthetics, they ONLY DESERVE THE BEST! Give them the best mechanical engineering our American engineers can produce. 
If I could even ask for taxes I want to pay for their coverage of their needs through tax. 
The vets have been silenced for nearly 4 years under this. 
We need to take care of our own. Immigrant social security is depleted our resources as millions come in it takes a whole year to make a dispute for disability for those who desperately need it. 
Illegal immigrants is what I mean.

Yes, a lot of that does have to do with states, but at the same time, one of Joe Bidens first intial arguments is that trump had the most outstanding national debt (while lowering the tax bracket for the middle class.) Meanwhile the middle class is basically being eviscerated with Joe Biden in office. Help that make sense."

@josephfuselier,I can't wait until President Donald Trump   and be elected again. Our nation has gone through too much B.S. in power struggles. President Donald Trump focuses on issues and in his Buisness style has action plans that he will do. No grey areas there at all! The economy and illegal immigration are paramount. Biden is way too old and he tends to walk off stage when asked questions. Trump knows national security and defense needs. In Afghanistan 🇦🇫 Biden waited far toolingand the Taliban got 86 Billion dollars worth of munitions and night vision goggles. General Milley should have been removed and replaced. Advanced intelligence showed the Taliban fast moving in the areas. We had some aircraft own out to Pakistan and other areas. Trump has the buisness plan as Biden/ Karmala Harris Administration are totally clueless. So much so that Democratic Party are talking about removing him from the party candidate ticket! It is a no brainer to see that Trump is clear thinking and has better buisness planning skills far superior than what the Democratic Party  could ever have! Illegal immigration is shocking as Joe Biden is guilty for letting all of this happen.
@jw791plus3,Biden hasn't told a single truth yet
@helderfilipe2000,"Trump or biden. Both disaster  . Biden is senile and trump is a lier.

Basically biden team is weak to prepare debates and his team should let him know how weak he is. Trump just make assumptions on how great he is in the entire usa history and cannot answer any direct questions. Usa is full of stupidly right now and have a dodo and a zombie running for usa democracy.  What a moment of ignorance new ideology you have right now.

Then, Biden still modulated his voice, made eye contact with the whole audience and sounded confident and lucid.  Now, he stares into space trying to regurgitate all the talking points fed to him.  For reference, here's the first debate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjW6WKpSCeQ"
@imshaunnurse,Lol raising taxes means less revenue and less to pay people. Unemployment would soar through the roof. If they hire too many people they will be bankrupt due to the minimum wage and tripled taxes. So mass layoffs will happen. Its common sense but some people dont understand economics

No matter who they choose to replace him, the same ""values"", lies, agendas and results will keep multiplying unless Trump can be elected to clean up this awful mess!! We need to remind all sides that we have all been lied to about this administration since Biden became president and that the Biden administration is one of the the most terrible frauds, ever perpetrated on this country! And when this administration replaces Biden with a new puppet, the USA will only continue to be run by incompetent, mentally ill people until Trump gets in to repair the country!!"

@peterlustig8778,Biden is a criminal going after his political opponents. Why does no one mention that the Supreme Court has just ruled that hundreds of the cases brought against the protesters on Jan 6th are A GOVERNMENT OVEREACH trying to procecute peaceful protesters after the capitol Hill police willings let them in?

They have cut off aid and health insurance from us, and they are sending money to wars and to Ukraine and Israel"

@andreylebeuf1304,"It's pretty obvious what happened: Trump couldn't care less about the facts. His only agenda was to confuse Biden, and make him look like a deer in headlights, and senile. Trump succeeded. This is incredibly dirty pool. Very sick.

Trump is the poster  child of people with extrinsic values, like the extreme right-wing does.  People with extrinsic values are strongly motivated by the potential or the prospect of individual 

reward, praise, attention. They're more likely to objectify people; to exploit other people; to behave rudely aggressively; contemptuously dismiss social impacts or morality, and environmental impacts. They are motivated by prestige status power image Fame wealth money."

@crossvinburn831,"Here are the three steps that are needed to get saved and be right with God who loved us all , for eternal life with him! 
As everyone and anyone can get saved! :[)

1-Admit you’re a sinner and be willing to turn from your own self righteousness to God.

2-Believe onto Jesus Christ, who being the only begotten Son of God, died on the cross, was buried and resurrected for the full forgiveness of our sins as a free gift out of God’s love for us.

3-Confess onto God, asking to be saved accepting this free gift of salvation, to start a new life of being born again, after being saved and forgiven from all your sins. :)

(The romans road to salvation from the King James Bible.)
Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB)
10. ""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:""
11.""There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.""
12.""They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.""
23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB)
8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.""
9.""Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.""
12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:”

Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)
9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”
10.""For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.""
13.""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.""

Romans 6: 23 (KJB)
“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

(An example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.)
“Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving. I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. I trust in him alone to save me. Nothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus. I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”

(More related scripture.)
John 3: 15-17 (KJB)
15.""That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.""
16.""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""
17.""For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”

1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB)
1.""Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2.""By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.”
3.""For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;”
4.""And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”

Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)
27.""And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:""
28.""So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

Ephesians 2: 8-9 (KJB)
8.""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:""
9.""Not of works, lest any man should boast.”

Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)
""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”"

It's not a ""popularity contest like a show"" or a ""Who can roast each other more"" or ""What side can ""ha got em!"" the most"" and or ""Which person can we laugh at more"" -- You do know this is about Democrats vs Republicans? The very core of what Democrats still stands for (not Biden) And what the Republicans still stands for (not Trump, although in this case Trump rewired and influenced a lot of how downhill the Republican party has gotten), Biden barely indirectly affected (Strayed away from) anything what the Democrats believe in and are for (As in, their ways still stands behind everything what being Democrats/Liberal means) he didn't completely 360 the perspective of Democrats agenda and views

 Sure Biden is like the worst (speaking wise) that Democrats has and have had, but Bidens intents were still humble, still more mature acting (as in not immaturely spewing lies, fear, and acting immaturely, if it wasn't for Bidens old age/bumbling of words, then the intents and what he stands for would of been more clear), but many Trump trolls still looks at this as a ""Bahahaha Biden so old what a joke!"" - ""Trump with his big mouth, ego, down talking anyone but himself surely wont draw negativity and bad things from our allies, big businesses, corporates and foreign affairs all for one mans ego, right?

Look Biden is not no miracle (far from it) but when it comes to serious things that matters, handling it without getting too egotistical, handling without a toxic fan base to ""rip on everyone else"", to still show an ounce of humbleness despite the old age and failing speaking, says a lot about Biden over Trump any day, and not only that but still says A LOT about the two parties in comparison to the grander scheme of things, it's all about and still has always been about what party (Democrats or Republicans) you want running the country, not indirectly of which Person is ""oh so perfect/likable"" although yes that would majorly help both parties, but both person Trump and Biden are an extreme embarrassments themselves. It's why of what the Democrats stands for and what they still stand for has been the same as it ever has been like in 2008-2016 and in 2020, Biden is quite garbage, but the Democratic party as a whole still didn't faulter as badly and chaotically as the Republican party."

Trump’s concern about ‘corruption’ in Ukraine is highly selective and remarkably convenient
He hasn’t shown similar concern about basically any other country, and the United States sends more aid to even more corrupt ones.

He has rarely mentioned corruption in other countries

A search through Trump’s past comments on corruption shows he has rarely raised concerns about corruption in foreign countries — except when it suited his political purposes.

When was in office , Trump referred to Romania’s “tremendous corruption problem,” but only after being asked about it and saying the Romanian president (who was sitting next to him) was the right man to tackle it. He also, in 2018, hailed the visiting Nigerian president in a similar way.

He has regularly talked about corruption in Venezuela, which segues nicely into his arguments about the dangers of socialism.

Other instances in which Trump has decried governmental corruption: No dire warnings about corruption in North Korea or Saudi Arabia, Russia  or Turkey.

And indeed, Ukraine appears to be the first country that we know about that Trump has actually threatened if it doesn’t root out corruption.

The U.S. gives lots more money to countries more corrupt than Ukraine!

The above fact looms large. If, theoretically, Trump simply decided that it’s time to start tying foreign aid to getting rid of corruption, Ukraine is apparently the first country he has zeroed in on. But Ukraine would seem to be an odd starting place, given there are many more corrupt countries that receive much more U.S. aid.

According to USAID, Ukraine in fiscal 2018 ranked 25th in the amount of U.S. aid it received — economic, military and other. Of the 24 countries who received more aid, 13 ranked as more corrupt than Ukraine on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.

AND IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT CORRUPTION UKRAINE IS LESS CORRUPT THAN RUSSIA AS RUSSIA IAT  138 RANKING (together with Mexico and Papua New Guinea) AND UKRAINE IS AT 120 RANKING ---- Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index is the less corrupted the higher number Denmark is nr 1 on the list and Somalia is 180 on the list ."

@user-oq5op4hk3x,"Russia’s Resource Grab in Ukraine

What is the real reason for the war in Ukraine?


IS THE REASON That Ukraine’s extraordinary riches in energy, minerals, and agriculture are a prize for the Kremlin.???

OR IS THE REASON The Russia’s motives for invading Ukraine vary from security fears to revisionist historical claims that a Ukrainian national identity does not exist. ??


We have all heard about the ""reason "" for Putins invasion of Ukraine ;  In a TV address at the outset of Russia’s invasion, the country’s president Vladimir Putin said that the objective was to “demilitarize and de-nazify Ukraine”. But this has been dismissed as a baseless pre-text upon which Putin justified a land-grab against an independent state.


BUT LETS TAKE A CLOSER LOOK SHALE WE !

The systematic slaughter of thousands of people is madness. However, some observers argue that, while Putin’s means may bear the hallmarks of lunacy, his end is decidedly more rational. They speculate that the Russian leader ordered the invasion of Ukraine to strike a blow in the battle for control of the means of delivering the global energy transition. 

The logic of the argument is this: prior to the Russian invasion, it had been estimated that Ukraine had around 500,000 tonnes of high-quality lithium – a key component of the batteries used in electric vehicles and energy storage systems – and consequently the country was set to become a “key player in the global transition to green technology”.

Lithium’s crucial role in our daily lives

It’s worth a brief note here highlighting exactly how important lithium is in our day-to-day lives. As the US mining company Piedmont Lithium succinctly sums it up on its website: “Lithium plays a critical role in much of what we do in our daily lives. In addition to EVs, lithium is an essential part of the technology that powers mobile phones, computers, power tools and battery storage of energy generated from wind and solar power.” Right now, you are reading this article on a device that is powered by a battery with lithium in it. Meanwhile, the energy transition will be largely driven by wind and solar projects that produce energy that is stored in lithium batteries. Research has shown that lithium-ion batteries account for 85 per cent of newly installed energy storage capacity. As the chart below shows, worldwide demand for lithium will soar from 685,000 metric tonnes in 2023 to 2.1 million tonnes by 2030.




Dig into the earth near the Ukrainian city of Dniprorudne, and you'll hit ore with an iron content of over 60%.

Before the war, about 4.5 million tons of this high-quality iron ore were mined each year — with the lion's share exported to Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Austria. Selling this strategically important resources earned Dniprorudne mines the equivalent of €200 million ($216 million) per year. One-third of the ore was made into steel at a plant to the west, in the city of Zaporizhzhia, and also exported.

But all that changed in the summer of 2022, when Russian troops occupied Dniprorudne. Ukraine's highly coveted and strategically important natural resources are now being sent to Russia. Ukrainian, Slovak and Czech investors in the mining business have had their property seized by Russia. 

Metallurgy ore exports fell by nearly 60% in 2022 from 2021, dropping to a total value of less than $3 billion (€2.8 billion), according to industry analysts GMK Center, a Ukraine-based think tank. Part of this drop is attributed to Russia's occupation of Ukrainian mining regions. In 2022, the Canadian think tank SecDev estimated the total value of deposits in occupied Ukraine at over $12 trillion. In addition to iron ore, key resources such as coal, titanium and manganese are found in Ukraine. Gold, natural gas, oil, kaolinite, salt, gypsum, zirconium and uranium are also present.

BUT THE BIG PRIZ IS LITHIUM !!!

Coveted lithium reserves
Today, lithium is one of the world's most sought-after minerals, as it is needed for smartphone and car batteries, among other things. Ukraine is trying to to woo foreign investors with promises of the ""largest lithium reserves in Europe"" 

Russia is eyeing the two mega Ukrainian lithium deposits out of the  total of four  to exist in the country. One of them, at Kruta Balka, lies in the Zaporizhzhia region, which has been under Russian occupation since spring 2022. The other, Shevchenko, is situated in the Donetsk region, only a few kilometers from the front line and the other two is also under Russian occupation 

Russia also occupies also three of Ukraine's rare earth deposits, according Kashchuk. The resource expert added that zirconium, uranium, but especially graphite and titanium will grow in demand.

""Graphite is used in battery production and coveted,"" he told DW. Two of Ukraine's graphite deposits are under Russian control. Yet the remaining four remain under Ukraine's control, and at one, mining is already underway, he said.

Ukraine before that war had  great potential for Ukraine to becom a major titanium supplier in the world . Already today, the country produces 7% of the world's titanium, placing it in the global top five; 

And where dose all of those  resources  just happened to be located yes you got it in east and south of Ukraine !!"
@user-oq5op4hk3x,"""The reason why Putin attacked  Ukraine  is not because he wants Ukraine, or only Ukraine. (Yes it's true Putin wants to claw back a type of RuZZian empire uSSr type 2.0 with him a tzar; but that is not just the only reason )

The reason he attacked Ukraine  is because they have chosen to be a democracy and the Ukrainian ppl  have made steps towards the Euro-Atlantic and European aspirations. 

So it's also an attack on democracy, western why of life and values of personal freedom/ choice  and rule of law ; and I believe nobody is safe if Ukraine will be attacked and if it falls. Ukrainians know what the USSR was they know what Russia is and they  do not want to be part of a type of Soviet Union mark 2 version with Putin as the  tzar or any type of a  Russian Empire or some sort of a Russian controlled Federation. 

The Ukrainian ppl.  want to be sovereign, and stay sovereign and they have prove that time and time again and are now showing they world this fact by fighting hard for their  independence. And if Ukraine will be further attacked by Russia because of the massive  bombs / shelling  military campaign ends up falling to Russia control then Ukraine will be the first of many to come;  

Anyone that thinks Russia will stop with Ukraine is highly naive as the Russians  will not stop in Ukraine- after Ukraine. So that's why it's in the interest of Europe and all democratic world to help to defend ourselves by helping to defend Ukraine , but also last but not least to show Russia and all other rogue pariah states and global dictatorships in all but name like China, that the international rule of law , democracy and human rights still works."""

@user-oq5op4hk3x,"US. and UK., gave Ukraine a guarantee  of  protecting Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity based on the 1991 borders that included Crimea and east Ukraine Luhansk and Donbass..

As of the result of the  Budapest Memorandum of 1994, US., gave Ukraine a guarantee that the  US, stands now as a grantor  of Ukraine sovereignty , becouse Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons and back then, Ukraine had the world's third-largest nuclear weapons stockpile !!

This guarantee  was  reconfirmed by United States when in 2009 released a statement that the memorandum's security assurances would still be respected after the expiration of the START Treaty

After the annexation of Crimea by in 2014, The US, Canada, the UK, France along with other countries, stated that Russian involvement was a breach of its obligations to Ukraine under the Budapest Memorandum and in violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Let me explain and give some Content !!

According to the Budapest Memorandum of 1994,  Russia, the US and the UK confirmed their recognition of  Ukraine becoming parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and effectively abandoning their nuclear arsenal to Russia and that they would:

1. Respect Ukrainian independence and sovereignty in the existing borders.

2. Refrain from the threat or the use of force against Ukraine.

3. Refrain from using economic pressure on  Ukraine to influence their politics.

4. Seek immediate action to provide assistance  Ukraine if they ""should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used"".

5. Refrain from the use of nuclear arms against  Ukraine.

6. Consult with one another if questions arise regarding those commitments


We need to understand that EITHER the word/ deals and / or the grantees of the west are worth something or they are not !!

And here we can clearly see what such guarantees with the west is worth,  it has been 8 years now since Russia invaded Ukraine in the east of the country and annexed parts of Ukraine in Crimea AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED so now Russia is going all inn and taking everything THE CAN!!

That is the result of worthless grantees !! 

And here's something the  WEST is clearly overlooking ; Taiwan , Israel and everyone else is also asking the question; CAN I TRUST THE WEST TO HOLD TO THEIR WORD  AND STAND BY THE GUARANTEES THEY GIVE ! and  not just Taiwan and Israel, is right now asking themselves those questions, but even small eastern European NATO member states that border Russia, will be asking themselves those questions as well !! IT'S ABOUT TRUST YOU LOSE TRUST YOU LOSE EVERYTHING!!

And her is the real kicker ; Also Iran, North Korea and China will be seeing what is going on and soon they will be thinking the west is weak; And the will be thinking and saying things like, just look what the west  did when Russia was calling out their bluff about red lines in Ukraine  ... The time is now, we have our chance to stick it to them !!!!  

And then we will see China take Taiwan  (so no more silicon-chips for you ) and then we will see Iran take Israel (middle east oil all gone and the middles east  up in fire ) And  when North Korea goes into South no more south Korea as north will take it over as well !!

@user-oq5op4hk3x,"THE AID TO UKRAINE IS NOT REALY FREE MONEY .. Its more like buying yourself a new cell phone and giving the old away to your kid, and claiming you gave your kid $2,000 (the price of the new phone) because he now has your old cell phone and you have the new one !!!  

NOW LET ME EXPLAIN 

The aid is not pallets of cash. It’s in the form of military equipment, assigned a value, that is donated,”. “That equipment is usually older and would be replaced in the next few years anyway, at a cost. I’m sure she doesn’t understand this.”

Still, the largest bucket of overall U.S. aid committed to Ukraine — more than $46 billion, is military support in the form of equipment NOT cash !!  

The military equipment has  been pulled directly from existing U.S. military old SURPLUS inventory that has a shelf date that soon will be past that date ; and will be needing replacement anyway this way US. gets to restock  its military equipment  with more newer updates versions and send the soon to by out of date to Ukraine and as a bonus US. military  saves the money it will have used  for destroying the old military equipment as well  !! 

Also  it is true other parts of the  Aid / funding will  be used to purchase new weapons and this will be sent to Ukraine; but all sales must be and will be bought from the US industrial complex  industry and  American manufacturers; this supports local American communities in states (over 33 states ) that produce weapon's  this helps marginalized communities and sates get a solid cash influx / bust into their local economy and supports jobs within the factors that will be producing those  new weapons.-.   

(So the money doesn't go into the pockets of Zelensky and fiends thats a myth pumped  out by Russian propaganda and regurgitated  by ""pathetic tools"" of the kremlin like Tucker Carlsen )     

Members of Congress have questioned how closely the U.S. is tracking its aid to Ukraine to ensure that it is not subject to fraud or ending up in the wrong hands. 

The Pentagon’s inspector general told lawmakers at a hearing,  that his office has found no evidence of such corruption or wrongdoing, but cautioned that investigations are only in their early stages. 

 The Pentagon’s inspector general also informed the Members of Congress that despite claims to the contrary, the United States is not sending bags of unaccounted-for cash to Ukraine. Most US contributions go to military aid, including weapons and equipment made by American defense contractors who employ communities across the country. When the United States spends money to purchase military equipment as part of an international aid package, the materiel may go overseas, but the money and jobs stay in America. Similarly, appropriations for the US Foreign Military Financing program provide incentives for NATO allies and partners to secure US-made capabilities. This translates to more business for US companies and sustained employment for rural communities in which they operate.


For instance, Lockheed Martin, maker of the HIMARS—which has been central to Ukraine’s counteroffensive—plans to increase its Camden, Arkansas facility’s workforce by 20%, and recently announced increased profit projections through the end of the year. Similarly, General Dynamics has committed to building new production facilities in Mesquite, Texas, bringing money and jobs to the region. Change like this takes place only when the Pentagon sends strong and stable market signals to the defense industry, giving it the confidence to expand and hire.

In short, the numbers suggest that continued support for Ukraine is a win-win for Ukrainians and the American people. 

The United States can continue to defend stability and democratic governance across the globe, while at the same time boosting American industrial output and advancing US economic interests.

So like i have said;  This is more like buying yourself a new cell phone and giving the old away to your kid, and claiming you gave your kid $2,000 (the price of the new phone) because he now has your old cell phone and you have the new one !!!  ITS A WIN WIN !!"

@user-oq5op4hk3x,"Appeasement & Armageddon: Giving in to Vladimir Putin’s nuclear blackmail will spark an unprecedented nuclear arms race and make a future nuclear war far more likely!! There is a reason why the Soviet Union, nor any nuclear power, never launched a first strike (nuclear attack) since World War 2, despite all of the Cold War fears that the Soviets would.

And it’s because you can't launch a first strike without being annihilated in the second strike. I remember in the 80s when The Day After aired, and everyone hoped the Soviets would see the movie and learn the lesson. Probably not realizing the Soviets can be trusted to act in the best self-interests...which mutually assured destruction is clearly against... and that the Soviets knew this since the 60s, if not the 50s. -- How is it any different today? 

Even if Putin had the launch codes (he doesn't), or the ability to order a first strike by himself (he doesn't), even he would know the response is not going to be 'more sanctions'. -- The only way I could fathom Russia using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, or against any enemy country, is the FSB had a foolproof plan to blame am ISIS terror cell, or rogue Chechen element, or claim the Ukrainians did it in a false-flag conspiracy to frame the Russians. -- But that would require a convincing story on how such an element got the nuclear weapon 'elsewhere', and eliminating everyone involved in the planning and execution. Whatever the case, Russia would need absolute plausible deniability. -- 

Here's my two cents, if there was really a way to use a nuclear weapon against an enemy without equal repercussions, Russia and China (and the US) would have figured it out a long time ago and did it already.

All NATO must do is take out Moscow and 5 -6 other cities to take out all of Russia.... But Russia must take out city's all over the planet from 

USA , CANADA ,FRANCE UK. ALL OF EUROPE and as far away as , AUSTRALIA and so on and so on ...

United Kingdom 225 warheads (submarine delivery systems new and up to date systems )

France 300 warheads
(submarine delivery systems new and up to date systems )

United States 7,315 warheads 
(Mixed delivery systems new and up to date systems )

Russia 8,000 warheads

@user-oq5op4hk3x,"Russia had intended to take control of the whole territory of Ukraine, but now it has gradually reduced to taking over Luhansk, Donetsk and parts of southern Ukraine, which is a much smaller area. Russia does not have enough military capability to stand firm on all fronts at once. If they are to advance a place, more forces they must be transferred there and Russia does not have the manpower to do that ...

It is clear that Russia has changed its goals in accordance  to how the war has gone for them (not good ) . Usually goals and objectives are sett  before you take any military action , But in  Russias case for Ukraine this end goals  has been turned  upside down and  how the taking of Ukraine was going to be done in 2 weeks has ended up for the Russia as  militarily  disaster  and the goals of the Russian military campaign TAKING all of Ukraine in 2 weeks (sorry special  military operation  as Putin called it ..Haha ) is now going into over

United States with European and NATO is back in track in European sphere of  geopolitics  ..  - The Putins war in Ukraine has led to arch-rival the United States being back at full power in Europe with large nuclear and conventional forces, closer to the borders of Russian than ever before. The US was  on their way to Asia, but now it seems that they are on their way back to Europe with firmer leadership, more weapons and are stronger and more firmly planted than they haven been since 1991 .

2. New NATO member states Putin needs to be sent a medal from NATO for outstanding good work as PUTIN has single handedly managed to intimidated two very important buffer states into NATO,  Sweden and Finland now  after years of neutrality joining NATO. Russia is now experiencing that the borders with NATO are doubling, and now there will be  even more American military infrastructure closer to their borders. (Yes master move by Putin hahaha )

3. Putin has also though his ""grand master geopolitical chess game"" ; Done the more or less unthinkable trick of getting  NATO member states to start work even closer together.. let mer point  out some facts ; 

Putins war in Ukraine is working as the glue that sticks NATO together; after being more or les fragmented for years they now have  returned together. - Russia benefited from the fact that NATO was an alliance with 30 different members before Sweden and Finland's membership, which meant that the alliance was fragmented. Russia is now facing a more entrenched alliance than before after the NATO members states have agreed to put away their petty political distances  their petty political differences like between Germany and Poland Spain and Italy and France  and Uk and even Hungary with Orban has come back into the flock  and EVEN TURKEY President Mr. Erdoğan has even compromised with other NATO member and EU  for the better good by letting  Sweden and Finland  join NATO..  (Yes another master geopolitical chess game move by Putin hahaha )


4. The fourth mistake and some say the biggest mistake is alienating Germany , now the German  parliament has green lighted a total rebuild of the German Army , Air Force and Navy to   show defensive muscles !!  Germany,  has now going to use 100 billion euros on renewing the country's defenses as a result of Putins war in Ukriane and some ppl. in Germany are even talking about the idea of taking back Kaliningrad enclave from Russia as it used to be German before ww2 .

- The German Bundeswehr (the German defense force.) Will have much greater economic muscle in the years to come and Germany will probably become a dominant European military power, not far from the Russian borders. This is a huge loss for Putin (So yes NOT really a checkmate move by the so called geopolitical chess player Putin now is it hahaha )

I CAN GO ON AND ON HOW PUTIN HAS MESSED UP BUT I THINK YOU GET MY POINT ; PUTIN IS WORSE OFF  NOW THEN HE EVER WAS !!"
@user-oq5op4hk3x,"Let me ask  this ; Who gives Putin the right to have ""a broader sphere of interest in Ukraine "" ???   We live in 2024 not 1824 !  

What about the people who live in ""that so called  sphere of interest""  that is the  sovereign country of Ukraine don't they (the Ukrainian ppl.)  have an "" sphere of interest in Ukraine itself  "" ? 

Shall the Ukrainians just  bend their knee and behave as slaves, and become some sort of quasi  2nd class nation/  country, and have their society run under the heel and accept being kicked by Kremlin's boot of the ""   sphere of Russian interest "" ; Should Ukraine  just roll over and let Russia controlled Ukraine for the sole benefit of Putin's klan agenda and  the geopolitical intrs. of the Moscow Kremlin  kleptocracy elites?: And let Ukraine  become some sort of quasi geographical entity for political advantages of the Kremlin ? 

 Or should Ukraine stand up and fight against such  tyrannical things as PUTIN'S ""sphere of interest"" as the independent European self governing state it is FIGHT for freedom, sovereignty  and self-rule ??

FACT !!! Ukraine was forced into this war by Russia not Russia by Ukraine (or anyone else ) Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has no choice he  needs to now be the president of a country, that is in a war defending its country and ppl.  against a brutal evilaggressor. And the authorities of the aggressor country do not want any peace.

@daveeggen,"Paris accords were a joke, no consequences for the biggest polluters, China, India and others. It's a huge redistribution of wealth"
@user-oq5op4hk3x,"Every agreement and decision made by NATO must be made in consensus and recorded filed and signed by ALL Nato member states before it becomes a fact !! NATO has time after time after time told Russia to show the world where this so called agreement is where is the document that shows such an agreement was ever made !!! And time after time Moscow cannot come up with any evidence , prof or any document to back up this so called agreement . WHY IS THAT ?? Because it never happened it's a myth made up by Moscow !!

There is no record of any such-decision having been taken by NATO. Personal assurances from individual leaders cannot replace Alliance consensus and do not constitute formal NATO agreement.

In addition, at the time (1989) of the ""promise"", the Warsaw Pact still existed so why will any such agreement have been made? . The Warsaw Pact members did not agree on its dissolution until 1991. (So based on that fact even if there was an agreement (and there never was one ) that agreement will have to been made with the USSR and the USSR no longer is a thing as it dissolved in 1991 so any agreement made is now none in void in other words no longer is valid because the USSR only belongs in the history books and can not be seen as a legal entity any more...

The idea of their accession to NATO was not on the agenda in 1989.

This was confirmed by Mikhail Gorbachev himself in an interview with Russia Beyond the Headlines: (just google :Mikhail Gorbachev Russia Beyond the Headlines or check out the link here
Headlines: see link https://www.rbth.com/international/2014/10/16/mikhail_gorbachev_i_am_against_all_walls_40673.html
expansion' was NOT discussed at all, and it wasn't brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Not a single Eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the WarsawPact ceased to exist in 1991. Westernleaders didn't bring it up, either.""

Newly declassified White House transcripts also reveal that, in 1997, Bill Clinton consistently refused Boris Yeltsin’s offer of a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ that no former Soviet Republics would enter NATO:

“I can’t make commitments on behalf of NATO, and I’m not going to be in the position myself of vetoing NATO expansion with respect to any country, much less letting you or anyone else do so…


Also on a side note like I have said before : if there was a such agreement (and there was not ) the agreement will have been with the USSR and the USSR as a country and legal entity no longer is a thing any more, it is only in the history books and therefor all legally binding verbal or otherwise contract with the USSR is no longer valid and has no legal standing, so even if such an agreement was a fact (and its not ) then it no longer has any binding moral or legality to it !!

NATO operates by consensus.”"

@user-oq5op4hk3x,"Putin did not begin the undercover proxy-war in 2014 so that it would end in peace, independency and prosperity for Ukraine and its people. and he did not start a all out war in 2022 for the  independency and prosperity for Ukraine and its people

This war does not hinder Putin, it facilitates his goals instead. 

Putin started it so it would end with the defeat of Ukraine and the Ukrainian peoples/ nations  aspirations of true self-government true independence and democratic nation, that was fare away from the hegemony control and orbit of Russia … IN OTHER words with our collapse of Ukrainian society. 

It helps him keep Ukraine on the Kremlin hook and hegemony control and helps Putin feel himself as an influential leader negotiating with the West. So, why would he need peace?

And before someone starts up about Russia right to protect  itself from the ""western incursion and decadent western incorrectness of political arrogance"" (whatever that means )  and therefor Russian needs a ""a broader sphere of interest in Ukraine "" 

Let me ask you this ; Who gives Putin the right to have ""a broader sphere of interest in Ukraine ""  we live in 2022 not 1822 ???  What about the people who live in ""that so called  sphere of interest""  that is the  sovereign country of Ukraine don't they (the Ukrainian ppl.)  have an "" sphere of interest in Ukraine itself  "" ? 

Shall the Ukrainians just  bend their knee and behave as slaves, and become some sort of quasi  2nd class nation/  country, and have their society run under the heal and accept being kicked by Kremlin's boot of the ""   sphere of Russian interest "" ; Should Ukraine just roll over and let Russia controlled Ukraine for the sole benefit of Putins klan agenda and  the geo political intrs. of the Moscow Kremlin  kleptocracy elites?: And let Ukraine  become some sort of quasi geographical entity for political advantages of the Kremlin ?

And the authorities of the aggressor country do not want any peace. 

(If the Russia army stops fighting today and goes home back to Russia tomorrow there will be NO war If Ukraine stops fighting today there will be NO Ukraine !!  )

Russians doesn't want to be a part of the  western democracy thats fine Ukraine does Ukrainian society has nothing  good to say about marximen or wokeisem or Russian imperialism they among Ukraine's stand absolutely equal and are seen with the disdain, loathing and contempt !!! 

 But like I say if Russia has no intrs.  and they feel Russia society values and norms living  is so much better than the despicable arrogant western world, just stay in Russia stop living inside the west stop buying  houses , sending your kids to western schools for a western education and holidays to the western world and stop using western products and technology no prob you go do you; you go be Russia no one is stopping you !! 

Why not try and stop emulating the west will at the same time rejecting the west and then on top of it claiming to be its equal .. here is a thought if you are the emulating the west you are a copy and a copy is just hard core evidence that the original is the better !! If your Russki Mir (Russian World ideology of imperialism and expansionism  )  was better than the western world; why do you not 100% just stick to being Russian why are you  emulating everything that is  western !! The answer is clear because its better than your Russki Mir !!

Ukraine, Georgia , Moldova  the Baltic's and the rest of Eastern Europe don't want your Russian world (KGB Putin Stalinism strong man BS ) they want  western democracy freedom and choice so let them make their own future there own mistakes and there own success those ppl. countries and nations don't want your Moscow /Kremlin HEGEMONY called Russki Mir  or your so called Russian greatness of special rights of so called 3rd Rome  !!   


Let's take a look at Ukraine and the same goes for Georgia and other countries  that Moscow  wants to bully and kick around !! 

Ukraine is a sovereign nation with rights and should be free to govern itself. Russia as a political entity has never had the best interest of the Ukraine and its people at heart. The Ukrainians have a distinct and rich culture, their own language, and a desire for self-rule, liberty and freedom to make decisions of its own. 

Russia wants to control Ukraine so it can obtain its resources for its own benefit (as has happened throughout history).  Ukraine in its east and south has in-fact the 3rd biggest oil and gas reservers in Europe and should those resources start getting taped  and sold to the west then Russia has a massive competitor on its hands for the European market  !! You don't believe me google Ukraine shield gas reserves !!

Russian control has never been for the benefit of the Ukrainian people. BUT HERE""S THE REAL POINT: even if it had been, Ukraine is still a sovereign nation and has the right to rule itself!!! 

The Russian state has sought to control Ukraine and to deceive the rest of the world into believing that there is no Ukrainian culture or language, and that Ukraine is simply a dissident Russian state through use of propaganda and oppression has repeatedly attempted to wipe out the Ukrainian people and culture.

 Do I need to mention the millions of Ukrainians killed by the Russian government? The fear and repression of Ukraine under Russian rule? The families lost behind the ""Iron Curtain?"" 

The Holodomor genocide when Russia  killed   10 mill Ukrainians  in 1933 - 1934 and after that replaced then with ethnic Russians manly in the east of Ukraine (todays Donbas ) for crying out loud? 

And that is why after 1991 the Ukrainians rally around their rich and beautiful culture - because it is THEIRS. And because they deserve a voice of their own, and to live free from the oppression of foreign state that seeks to exploit and obliterate them!

Russian controlled soviet union former satellite states like Poland, Romania, and Czech the Baltic states, Slovakia ect ect ect ...couldn't wait to join NATO and the EU to get as fare away from Russian hegemony control as fast as the possibly can at the time .


If the Russians weren't suchaaaaholes, they wouldn't have to worry about EU NATO and former satellite states like Poland, Romania, and Czech the Baltic states, Slovakia ect ect ect running too the front door of EU and NATO .

(PS : yes i agree not all is perfect in the west but is why better and has always been why better than anything Russia has come up with in history ; And that is why ppl from all over the world (including Russians ) move to Europe ,UK and US in the millions !!  ;  For all its faults that the western world has and it has a few, it still is 10000 times better than Russia , Africa or china !!! I mean no one is building a wall to hold ppl.  inside like Russian controlled Soviet Union did the US is in fact building walls to stop ppl. for coming inn and so dose European countries as well )j"

@user-oq5op4hk3x,"The aid is not pallets of cash. It’s in the form of military equipment, assigned a value, that is donated,”. “That equipment is usually older and would be replaced in the next few years anyway, at a cost. I’m sure she doesn’t understand this.”

Still, the largest bucket of overall U.S. aid committed to Ukraine — more than $46 billion, is military support in the form of equipment NOT cash !!  

The military equipment has  been pulled directly from existing U.S. military old SURPLUS inventory that has a shelf date that soon will be past that date ; and will be needing replacement anyway this way US. gets to restock  its military equipment  with more newer updates versions and send the soon to by out of date to Ukraine and as a bonus US. military  saves the money it will have used  for destroying the old military equipment as well  !! 

Also  it is true other parts of the  Aid / funding will  be used to purchase new weapons and this will be sent to Ukraine; but all sales must be and will be bought from the US industrial complex  industry and  American manufacturers; this supports local American communities in states (over 33 states ) that produce weapon's  this helps marginalized communities and sates get a solid cash influx / bust into their local economy and supports jobs within the factors that will be producing those  new weapons.-.   

(So the money doesn't go into the pockets of Zelensky and fiends thats a myth pumped  out by Russian propaganda and regurgitated  by ""pathetic tools"" of the kremlin like Tucker Carlsen )     

Members of Congress have questioned how closely the U.S. is tracking its aid to Ukraine to ensure that it is not subject to fraud or ending up in the wrong hands. 

The Pentagon’s inspector general told lawmakers at a hearing,  that his office has found no evidence of such corruption or wrongdoing, but cautioned that investigations are only in their early stages. 

 The Pentagon’s inspector general also informed the Members of Congress that despite claims to the contrary, the United States is not sending bags of unaccounted-for cash to Ukraine. Most US contributions go to military aid, including weapons and equipment made by American defense contractors who employ communities across the country. When the United States spends money to purchase military equipment as part of an international aid package, the materiel may go overseas, but the money and jobs stay in America. Similarly, appropriations for the US Foreign Military Financing program provide incentives for NATO allies and partners to secure US-made capabilities. This translates to more business for US companies and sustained employment for rural communities in which they operate.


For instance, Lockheed Martin, maker of the HIMARS—which has been central to Ukraine’s counteroffensive—plans to increase its Camden, Arkansas facility’s workforce by 20%, and recently announced increased profit projections through the end of the year. Similarly, General Dynamics has committed to building new production facilities in Mesquite, Texas, bringing money and jobs to the region. Change like this takes place only when the Pentagon sends strong and stable market signals to the defense industry, giving it the confidence to expand and hire.

In short, the numbers suggest that continued support for Ukraine is a win-win for Ukrainians and the American people. 

The United States can continue to defend stability and democratic governance across the globe, while at the same time boosting American industrial output and advancing US economic interests.

So like i have said;  This is more like buying yourself a new cell phone and giving the old away to your kid, and claiming you gave your kid $2,000 (the price of the new phone) because he now has your old cell phone and you have the new one !!!  ITS A WIN WIN !!"

@alpacamybag9103,How many times did Biden crap himself? I bet Trump wanted to puke from the stench.
@KaVaKaZi,"As a European I will tell you that America is the laughing stock of the world. At this time you have a senile, demented old man who cant walk normally up the stairs for a president. And his opponent is a straight up crook. What are you people doing voting for these people? Are you truly fine with the entire world looking at your country like a bad circus?"

@Forsaken187,#TRUMP2024 💯💯💯
@Forsaken187,CNN turned off their comments just so they wouldn't have everybody praising Trump 😂😂😂
@marcellop3163,"I am a Trump supporter all the way and I hate what Joe Biden and his administration did in his disastrous term, he was the worst President ever but this was so hard to watch even for a Republican, to be honest it's not even funny anymore, all of us will get old and many of us will get to the place where Joe is...senile dementia, I have elderly parents who are having senile issues and I don't like to make jokes about it. I think democrats are just cowards letting a cognitively struggling old man fighting against Trump who will obviously destroy him,  if democrats had some common sense they would retire Joe, this is like watching 80's Mike Tyson fighting a 15 yo featherweight...terrible debate.
MAGA 2024"

@user-uf2xn9qr3g,"am your sister from Yemen, and by Allah I only spoke out of hunger and distress. My mother, my brothers, and I  lessons and tears. We are in a situation that only God knows about. God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs for those who brought us to this situation. By Allah Almighty, I did not write this appeal out of distress and distress. Poverty, O world, they have felt it So, I hope for you. By Allah Almighty, Lord of the Great Throne, he ate what I had in the house. By Allah, my brothers, he is my brothers by sitting in the house. Who has no food? By God, we are in a very difficult situation. We have 4 people entering the house, and my father has died, and there is no one who can depend on us and who lives in it.We live in a rented house because we cannot pay the rent we owe. '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' '''''''''''''  My brother, my first words are: I swear to God that I will not lie to you or deceive you. I am a Yemeni girl displaced from the war. My family and I live in a rented house in Al-Shahrab 20,000 Yemenis amongs, and now we owe 60,000 for 3 months. The owner of the house is one of the people who does not have mercy, by God, my brother. He comes every day, insulting us, talking about us, and moving from the house to the street because we were unable to pay him the rent. The neighbors saw us crying and came back.They came back to talk to the neighbors and we were given the weekend. So we made him swear by God. He will take us out into the street. Have mercy on him and us. Our country is due to this war and we do not find food for our day, and my brothers and I live in a difficult life. Our father died, may God have mercy on him, and we have no one in this world who was with us in these harsh circumstances. My younger brothers went out into the street and saw...The neighbors eat and stand at their door in order to give them bread even if they break it. By God, to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, they closed the door and expelled them and came back crying. They are dying of hunger. No one has mercy on them and a holiday is returned. I have made a living, and now if us helps us with a kilo of flour, I swear to God, I am dying of hunger. My brother, I am an alien to God. Then, I ask you to help me for the sake of God. I ask you, by God, to love goodness and to help me, even if you can, by messaging me on WhatsApp.On this number 00967711013075   and ask for the name of my card and send it and do not be late and may God reward you with all the best, my brothers Sagar, see how they are and help us and save us before they throw us out in the street, you will be lost or we will die of hunger. My family and I ask you, by God, if you are able to help us, do not be late and may God reward you well..`/--~««............><<_>_<..<.<.>.........."
@philosophyforum4668,"What happened here was a pre-determined, media-orchestrated take-down of Biden. Leftist journalists have been planning this for some time. Biden didn’t do anything in this debate that he hasn’t been doing for the last several years. The leftist media has always covered for him in the past, and now that cover is crumbling. Biden’s performance in the debate was irrelevant to them. Biden’s policies are irrelevant. The hive mind of the leftist media simply has decided that they are no longer willing to tolerate Biden’s senility. The media never cared about his senility before. They criticized Trump as much as they could, but Trump doesn’t depend on the leftist media like Biden does. This is why CNN wanted control of the debate. This is why they wanted the debate so early – so the DNC could find another candidate. There is only one problem. Biden’s senility is only a small part of the problem. The main problem is that Democrats all agree on the same crazy policies that are causing chaos in the nation."
@TheMischiefmanaged,NANCY POLOSI REFUSED EXTRA SECURITY PRESIDENT TRUMP REQUESTED MORE THAN ONCE.
@Mikee22ification,"Three greatest threats to the US and the world right now, and the Democrats-Biden are dealing with them, and the Republicans-Trump will not:
1. Russia under Putin is a fascist state and will continue to take over Europe – one they takeover Ukraine they will continue to take Finland and the Baltics and then Poland etc, which is a threat to the US and a large trading partner.
2. China under Xi Jinping is a fascist state and will continue to take over the Asia-Pacific, they have taken Hong Kong, soon Taiwan, then the Philippines etc, which is a threat to the US interests in security and economics.
3. Democracy is threatened by militant groups and the unaccountable military-industrial complex (as quoted by Eisenhower) and billionaires – they will undermine democracy for their own interests and are not held accountable to the law."

@josetrevino6674,"Ecclesiastes 7:1-4 
1 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of DEATH than the day of one’s BIRTH. 
2 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. 
3 Sorrow is better than laugher: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. 
4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools in the house of mirth."
@southernbelle2478,"Im so sorry i don't care for either of these clowns but if i have to choose between them to run the country i would choose trump. Biden has opened our boarder, given thousands to illegal immigrants and cant even help our veterens. Almost got us involved in world war 3. Caused us to go into inflation. Trump is not perfect either and he says things the wrong way that can be offensive sometimes but i feel like we we're doing better those 4 years then we are now. Unfortunatley dems are gonna just vote for biden soley because they are told to and don't like how trump says things sometimes. Im independent. I am gonna vote for whoever i believe can run the country better. I am not glued to a certain party. If a democrat candidate is a better fit then a republican that is who i am voting. If a republican candidate is a better fit that is who i am voting."
@MJrev,"Respectfully, how tf y’all’s country end up like this 😂"
@Kryptic513,3 million views but only 24 comments?? Suspicious 🤨
@robungerer3813,"I still don't understand why Biden agreed to the debate the way it is constructed.  This was an opportunity for Trump to put more distraction, 
lies about the real issues that matter...  Distraction ?, yes, because this 'debate' is more like a contest : ""Who is the best host to lead a talkshow"".
The country needs an integer reliable servant to form and energize a skilled team of experts and advisers, who do care about the country ...
not an unreliable ego trip despot, hungry for applause, with a team of greedy loyalists, like himself.
Everyone knows he will lie his repeated mantra of the same lies, carved in stone by now ... in this scenario, Trump had all he needed.
Both candidates had/have  a POTUS term ... so it's not hard to determine if the results were just empty words or accomplished support.
Be aware ... electing Trumpis an irreversible permanent choice ; it is recommended to read the maga ""project 2025"" carefully first :
